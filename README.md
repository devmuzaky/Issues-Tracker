# IssueTracker

## Project overview

In this project, we will build an Angular application for managing and tracking issues
using reactive forms and Clarity. Initially, we will display a list of issues in a table that
we can sort and filter. We will then create a form for allowing users to report new issues.
Finally, we will create a modal dialog for resolving an issue. We will also go the extra mile
and turn on suggestions when reporting an issue to help users avoid duplicate entries.
